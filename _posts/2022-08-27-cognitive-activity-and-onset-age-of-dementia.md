## Introduction

---

- According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the world population aged over 60 years will have doubled
in number by 2050, with an estimated total of 2 billion people. `WHO. Ageing and Health (WHO, 2018).`

- Dementia is not considered a normal sequela of aging and prevention should be the key
strategy to mitigate the identified risk factors. `Livingston, G. et al. Dementia prevention, intervention, and care: 2020 report of the Lancet Commission. The Lancet 396, 413–446
(2020).`

## Results
---

Statistically significant dif-
ferences were observed for the different CMG (p < 0.001) and within the CMG for the different age groups for Memory Sweep (p = 0.013), Babble Bots (p < 0.001) and Unique (p < 0.001).

### CMG Score
As for the initial scores, we observed an interesting linear trend between age and session, indicating that all participants improved in all
CMG but that the progress was slower in older participants.

## Discussion
---
- Though the changes in different cognitive abilities over the lifespan are relatively well-documented, there
is less evidence on the plasticity of these different cognitive functions across the lifespan. Furthermore, it has not yet been established whether all cognitive functions can be trained or the extent to which progress can be achieved in healthy subjects of different ages. These are both important questions in the field of cognitive training. Neuroplasticity is the ability of the brain to modify its structure and function for example under conditions of learning or compensation. We studied a healthy population and therefore the observed improvements are most likely due to training-induced plasticity rather than compensation. Previous studies have shown neuroimaging and neurotransmitter changes after cognitive training of working memory in healthy people 27–29 , that could ultimately lead to an increase of cognitive reserve.
