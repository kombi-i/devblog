## Objective

---

To test the hypothesis that higher level of cognitive activity predicts older age at dementia onset in Alzheimer disease (AD) dementia. 

## Results 
--- 

During a mean of 6.8 years of follow-up, 457 individuals were diagnosed with incident AD at a mean age of 88.6 (SD 6.4, range 64.1–106.5) years. In an extended accelerated failure time model, higher level of baseline cognitive activity (mean 3.2, SD 0.7) was associated with older age at AD dementia onset (estimate 0.026; 95% confidence interval 0.013–0.039). 

Low cognitive activity (score 2.1, 10th percentile) was associated with a mean onset age of 88.6 years compared to a mean onset age of 93.6 years associated with high cognitive activity (score 4.0, 90th percentile).

>**Relation of Cognitive Activity to Age at Dementia Onset in Incident AD**

>Relation of high (blue line, score = 4.3, 90th percentile) and low (red line, score = 2.1, 10th percentile) cognitive activity at baseline to probability of remaining dementia-free, from an extended accelerated failure time model. AD = Alzheimer disease.

## Conclusion 
---

A cognitively active lifestyle in old age may delay the onset of dementia in AD by as much as 5 years.

Neither education nor early-life cognitive activity were associated with the age at which a person developed Alzheimer's dementia. Late-life level of cognitive activity plays a key role in delaying the onset of dementia.
