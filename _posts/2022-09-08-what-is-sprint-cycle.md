Agile Sprints are a short time period where you focus on working on one part of a project. This allows you to work effectively and *fast* on a project. A sprint is relatively short in terms of the entire project length, as it doesnt extend more than one month.


A sprint is broken up into four constituent parts: 
 - Sprint Planning
 - Daily Scrum
 - Sprint Review 
 - Sprint Retro 

## Sprint Planning 
Sprint planning is kind of part of the Scrum Cycle, but it kind of isn't. Sprint planning is where your team should try to answer two questions: How much work can we get done in this sprint, and how can we get this work done? During this time you effectively lay out the framework of the Sprint.

## Daily Scrum
Daily Scrum is a 15 minute event at the beginning of every Sprint session where your team makes a progress report, and adjusts the schedule as neccesary to make sure you are on time.

## Sprint Review 
Sprint review is one of the final steps in the Sprint cycle. This is where your team shows all of the progress that they have made in the Sprint Cycle, and makes sure that you have made adequate progress.

## Sprint Retro 
The Sprint Retro, or retrospective is the final step, where you and your team looks back on your Sprint Cycle and sees where they can improve, and where good progress was made so that your next Sprint Cycle can go as smooth as possible.
